#Memory Game Project

This game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game consists of cards that need to be matched, based on the classic game of Concentration.

## Game Description :

When you click a card, the timer will start. By clicking a card, the card will flip over, revealing it's symbol. The card will remain open. When you click on another card, it will then flip over to reveal it's symbol. If the symbol matches on both cards, they will remain open and change color. If they symbols on the cards **do not** match, they will flip back over and your job is to remember what symbols they were. When all the cards are matched, you win the game. A pop-up will show telling you your stats. You will then have the option to play again or not.
